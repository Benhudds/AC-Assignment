# AC-Assignment
An individual second year project for Advanced C++ demonstrating polymorphism.

A simulation of a basic Monopoly game demonstrating polymorphism in C++ and use of the STL. Polymorphism was not implemented fully in regards to the SpecialSquares as the cases were simple and required little code.
